# My-Work-Team-Dimension-Work-Days-and-hours-And-energy-needed-through-being-on-PIP
Mondays/Tuesdays and Fridays my work days,
overtime some days also, upto 18 hours extra some weeks,
spread that over a month snd thats bringing the bacon home.
Im on PIP for mobility, daily living also.
Back to work, in doing theraputic psychology sessions/Reverse psychology,
all day shifts, but doing different shifts, energy needed
